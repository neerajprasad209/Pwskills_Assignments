    "### Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by using automated software or tools, which can access the website's HTML code, parse it, and extract the desired information. This technique can be used to collect data such as text, images, URLs, and other structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web scraping is used for a variety of reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Market research: Companies can use web scraping to gather pricing information on products from competitor websites, or to collect customer reviews to improve their own products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Content aggregation: Web scraping can be used to gather news articles or blog posts from various sources and aggregate them on a single platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data analysis: Researchers or data scientists can use web scraping to collect data for analysis, such as social media data or information on public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are three specific areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. E-commerce: Web scraping can be used to gather pricing information and product details from e-commerce websites to gain insights into the market and competitor pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Social media monitoring: Web scraping can be used to monitor social media platforms for mentions of specific brands or products, which can help businesses to manage their online reputation or respond to customer inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Academic research: Web scraping can be used to gather data for academic research, such as collecting data on public opinion or political sentiment from news websites or social media platforms."

    "### MANUAL SCRAPING\n",
    "\n",
    "1. COPY-PASTING - In manual scraping, what you do is copy and paste web content. This is time-consuming and repetitive and begs for a more effective means of web scraping. It is however very effective because a website’s defences are targeted at automated scraping and not manual scraping techniques. Even with this benefit, manual scraping is hardly being done because it is time-consuming while automated scraping is quicker and cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AUTOMATED SCRAPING\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTML PARSING - There are many web scraping tools and libraries available that can extract data from websites. Some popular examples include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DOM PARSING - DOM is short for Document Object Model and it defines the style structure and content of XML files. Scrapers make use of DOM parsers to get an in-depth view of a web page’s structure. They can also use a DOM parser to get nodes containing information and then use a tool like XPath to scrape web pages. Internet Explorer or Firefox browsers can be embedded to extract the entire web page or just parts of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. VERTICAL AGGREGATION - Vertical aggregation platforms are created by companies with access to large scale computing power to target specific verticals. Some companies run the platforms on the cloud. Bots creation and monitoring for specific verticals are done by these platforms without any human intervention. The quality of the bots is measured based on the quality of data they extract since they are created based on the knowledge base for the specific vertical.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. XPATH - XML Path Language is a query language that is used with XML documents. XPath can be used to navigate XML documents because of their tree-like structure by selecting nodes based on different parameters. XPath can be used together with DOM parsing to scrape an entire web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. GOOGLE SHEETS - Google sheets are a web scraping tool that is quite popular among web scrapers. From within sheets, a scraper can make use of IMPORT XML (,) function to scrape as much data as is needed from websites. This method is only useful when specific data or patterns are required from a website. You can also use this command to check if your website is secure from scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. TEXT PATTERN MATCHING - This is a matching technique that involves the use of the UNIX grep command and is used with popular programming languages like Perl or Python."

    "### Flask is a web framework that is commonly used to build web applications and APIs in Python. While it is not required for web scraping, it can be useful in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the context of a web scraping project, Flask is used to create a simple web interface that allows users to input URLs or search queries and view the scraped data in a user-friendly format. For example, you could create a Flask app that takes a search query for a product on Flipkart, scrapes the results page, and displays the relevant information (such as product names, prices, and ratings) in a table on the app's homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Flask in this way can make it easier to share the results of your web scraping project with others, as they can access the scraped data through a web interface rather than needing to run the scraping code themselves."
