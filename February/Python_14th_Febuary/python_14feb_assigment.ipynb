    "1. A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching).\n",
    "2. Threading in python is used to run multiple threads (tasks, function calls) at the same time. Note that this does not mean that they are executed on different CPUs. Python threads will NOT make your program faster if it already uses 100 % CPU time. In that case, you probably want to look into parallel programming.\n",
